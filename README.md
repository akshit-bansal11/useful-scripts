## Merge Folders
A script that allows you to merge two or folders or their content to a new folder. (Yes it can merge an infinite no. of folders)


### Steps
- Download the script: merge-folders.py
- Make sure Python 3 is installed
    ```bash
    Pyhton --version
    ```
    You should get something like this
    ```bash
    python 3.--.--
    ```
- Run the script using cmd, powershell, bash, etc.
    ```bash
    python merge-folders.py
    ```
- Follow the steps on the output terminal and give these inputs:
  - source path (where all the folders are)
  - destination path (where you want all the folders or content to be)
  - select the 2nd option cause 1st one is just stupid

Note: I know its stupid of me to add the folder structure functionality as anyone can just copy paste the folders. Just the contents one would have been fine. But, I was stupid at the time so let's just ignore that
